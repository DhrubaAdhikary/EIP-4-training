1.) Convolutions -> Convolution is the means by which a picture, file of a said dimension is multiplied to a filter/Feature extractor to produce a feature matrix.


2.) Filter/Kernels -> a 3*3 matrix is ideally treated as an filter or matrix , which when applied on an sample extracts features from it .For example a straight edge filter when applied on digit 1 image will extract the straight line .


3.) Epochs -> It is defined as the number of times we go through the data , applying convolutions on it repeatedly to achieve maximum accuracy .

4.)1*1 convolution -> A 1*1 convolution is basically used to combine channels or seperate channels .

5.)3*3 convolution -> A 3*3 convolution refers to a 3*3 matrix that is multiplied repeatedly onto the input to extract features/edges/gradient from it . It basically refers to the operation of multiplying a 3*3 kernel .

6.)Feature Maps -> The outputs obtained after multiplying a kernel with the input is called as feature maps that hold meaningful information as to how to replicate the original input .

7.)Activation Function -> Activation function bacically reduce the magintude of the input while retaining all relevant information . It converts linear inputs into non linear space . 

8.)Receptive Field -> Receptive field explains the relationship of a sucedding layer with its preceeding layer . It basically defines how many pixels or bits of information the single unit of next layer is able to see or compute . It is broken into local receptive field i.e immediate preceeding layer and global receptive field i.e on a total how many pixels/bits of information from all preceeding layers it seen at that layer .
