1.) Convolutions -> Convolution is the means by which a picture, file of a said dimension is multiplied to a filter/Feature extractor to produce a feature matrix.


2.) Filter/Kernels -> a 3*3 matrix is ideally treated as an filter or matrix , which when applied on an sample extracts features from it .For example a straight edge filter when applied on digit 1 image will extract the straight line .


3.) Epochs -> It is defined as the number of times we go through the data , applying convolutions on it repeatedly to achieve maximum accuracy .

4.)1*1 convolution -> A 1*1 convolution is basically used to combine channels or seperate channels .

5.)3*3 convolution ->
